## How we satisfied the software requirements
For each of the F0 requirements, give a paragraph of explanation for how your game’s implementation satisfies the requirements.
Your team can earn partial credit for covering only a subset of the F0 requirements at this stage. (It is much better to satisfy the requirements in a sloppy way right now than lock in your partial credit.)

## Reflection
Looking back on how you achieved the F0 requirements, how has your team’s plan changed? Did you reconsider any of the choices you previously described for Tools and Materials or your Roles? It would be very suspicious if you didn’t need to change anything. There’s learning value in you documenting how your team’s thinking has changed over time.
